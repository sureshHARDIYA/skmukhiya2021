#### Preface

`Hands-on in C programming` is the result of many years of hard works done by professors, teachers, students and authors. This book is started and made `open-source` in order to motivate young readers who are interested to learn programming.

In the first edition of the book, we had only published the list of programming examples in each chapters.

`Hands-on in C programming` is always improved in each edition. We are always looking for constructive feedbacks and suggestions. So, if you feel that there could have been certain work done better than what is currently included, feel free to get in touch with any one of the contributors or please drop a line to [itsmeskm99@gmail.com](mailto:itsmeskm99@gmail.com).

All the best and happy programming!
