Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Høgskulen på Vestlandet](https://hvl.no/) in Bergen. I joined HVL on September 3rd, 2018, officially and being recruited for INTROMAT ([INTroducing personalized Treatment of mental health problems using Adaptive Technology)](http://intromat.no/).

Also, I am a computer graduate with a Masters in Information System from [Norwegian Universities of Science and Technology(NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.no/). My master thesis was entitled as Predicting next click log using process mining. This thesis proposes a methodology for revealing deep content interaction models from real life weblogs. The methodology is applied to weblog data from [Adresseavisen](https://www.adressa.no/), a regional news publisher in Norway. This thesis gives a brief literature overview of process mining, motivations for process mining, related works are done with process mining and tools for process mining. In addition to this, the project compares process mining with data mining as well as web usage mining. The dynamic nature of the Web and Information systems are becoming more and more intertwined with the operational processes.

My Bachelor degree was in _BSc.CSIT_ (Bachelor in Computer Science and Information Technology) where I studied about fundamentals of computer science and information technology including _Information System, Fundamentals of C programming, Database Management System, Software Engineering, Database Administration, Computer Network, Wireless Networking_, and others.

With both academic and professional knowledge, I am able to develop secured, optimized and professional web applications. My expertise also lies in frontend technologies like [REACTJS](https://reactjs.org/), [REDUX](https://redux.js.org/), [REDUX-SAGA](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `CMS` like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), `PHP` framework like `Laravel`. I am familiar with `TDD` ( Test Driven Development) as well as `SCRUM` as project management tool. `DBMS` like `MySQL`, `Postgresql`, `MongoDB` etc. I am both a team player and an independent developer. In addition to this, I am a data analyst enthusiast. I am very much experience in `Data analysis`, `Process mining` and making conclusions for big Enterprise.
